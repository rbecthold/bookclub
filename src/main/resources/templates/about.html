                    This is a project webpage for the CIS 530 course in the Bellevue University MS-CIS program.
                    About the project?  It will be a web app for a fake "Bellevue Bookclub" that our class is creating.
                    That's what it's about.  Here's something about me.

                    Here is a pic of me during a trip to Texas, it was such a fun experience!
                    I like to travel and see new places, but I sadly don't get the chance very often.
                    I used to be a big bookworm, but haven't done much reading for pleasure lately.
                    Maybe this project will give me some inspiration?  We shall see...
